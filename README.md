Brad Bosak SWDV 660 Week 4 Assignment

These two python files create a server and a client application.  Here are the steps for running:

1.  Run the server.py file in Eclipse or another code editor which will create a server socket and listen for pings
2.  Run the client.py file from the command line
3.  Enter the phrase you want to send to the server
4.  View the results in the code editor and the command line
	(if "Hello" is sent, then "Hi" will be returned.  Otherwise "Goodbye" will be returned)
5.  Rerun the client.py file to send a new phrase to the server if desired
